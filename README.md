Core AI features will be implemented during the hackathon.

- Skill-gap analysis
- Personalized roadmap generation
- Practice question generation
- Progress tracking dashboard

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Streamlit
- AI/LLM (to be integrated)

## Ethics and Constraints
- No scraping of restricted sources
- No storage of personal data without user consent
- Realistic learning timelines
- Source citations for retrieved content

## Hackathon Timeline
- Pre-submission: Repository setup and MVP scaffold
- Hackathon Day: Full feature implementation and demo
